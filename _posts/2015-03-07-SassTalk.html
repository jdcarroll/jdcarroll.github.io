<h2>Sass, Compass Jekyll</h2>

<p>One thing that I love about Sass and Compass is the variable feature inside Sass.  This makes build sites so much more clean and user friendly that I think I might not go grey from stress as quickly as others :)</p>

<p>When playing with Sass and compass in jekyll I am realizing how important structure really is with these types of generated frontend sites.. I have had experience doing this type of templating before using php with,</p>
    {% highlight ruby %}
        <?php include 'somePhpFile.php' ?>
    {% endhighlight %}
<p>But this takes templating to a whole new level targeting every possible element on the page. It super helpful also because Jekyll builds this in my by building everything with variables waiting for you to stylize and assign values. It still means that you have to use their 960 grid if you if you want to use their variable based system but that's not all bad.</p>

<p>I however do not plan on keeping this system I am in the process of building this jekyll site to be my portfolio page for know, until I can change it to something cooler. Because of this I am running into a variety of problems like building the navigation on the site.</p>

<p>Currently the navigation on my site is single page using anchor elements to target the specific elements on the page.  Jekyll one, is designed for a blog type site which doesn't necessarily work with single page in mind. and because of this fact I am forced to rethink the structure of my site which I don't mind doing its just that it is taking a bit longer that i would have wanted.</p>

<h2>Analytics</h2>

<p>Analytics is a fascinating and scary thing.  It is fascinating because you can virtually analyze every detail of a users process of using a website and it is terrifying because of the information that can be collected about the user.</p>

<p>One of the most terrifying thing about analytics is that there are tools out there like "NirSoft" that enable the analyst to view the users entire internet history. This can also be used when applying for a job or anything.. Now imagine this, its not the company that is interested in highering you but it is a hacker group interested in finding sensitive information about you to be used for a nefarious purpose.</p>

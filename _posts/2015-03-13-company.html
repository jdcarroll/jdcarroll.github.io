<p>I have been given a assignment where the requirement is to choose a company that needs an updated website.  The company that I chose is called CTX Fitness it is a gym off Edgewater drive in orlando florida.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.ctxfitnessorlando.com">Click here</a> to see the CTX fitness current website</p>


<p>I have several goals to update the website.  They are listed as following</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>Site Architecture - The organization of the sight really needs works. I plan to have 4 main links</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Training</li>
        <li>Blog</li>
        <li>Shop</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The training links and the blog will have sub categories but i am not sure that they need to be full blown links but maybe just filters.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Color optimization - When I say this I mean that I will use color to my advantage by making the website as usable as possible.  I am using the <a href="http://www.lifetimefitness.com">Lifetime Fitness</a> website as a tool and baseline to build upon. During the discover period the client really liked this website.</p></li>

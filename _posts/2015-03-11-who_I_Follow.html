<h2>Chris Coyier Saved my Career</h2>

    <p>So in my other life I was an IT Guy.  I was responsible for maintaining the apple systems within the company, but like any job, you start off doing one task and then the next thing you know you are responsible for hundreds of things.</p>
    <p>It truly is how people go crazy, but that is besides the point. One particular assignment was to build a Customer File Sharing Website(CFS) where customers can upload and download files to and from our developers.  This required me to learn PHP HTML Javascript and CSS on the fly.</p>
    <p>I had never written a single line of php and my javascript skills were abysmal. Luckily there was a guy in the office who took the time to teach me a little to get me started. After he showed me the basics of PHP I found Lynda.com and learned more complex php and advanced CSS.</p>
    <p>Here I was learning programing languages on the fly at a job where they required me to know them already.</p>
    <p>Because I needed to know these languages I learned how to use a plugin and believe me when I say that saved my life. But because of this massive, overwhelming project I learned What I needed to know in order to be successful.</p>
    <p>I was websites like <a href="http://www.php.net">php.net</a> and <a href="http://www.css-tricks.com">CSS Tricks</a> that got me through this project and I probably would not have survived.</p>

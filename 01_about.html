<p>As a developer, I love a challenge. I love to play with technology and all the things that go along with that. I do graphics, video, coding, systems adminstration, and list goes on and on. What do you need?</p>

<p>I am a developer and a philospher. I constantly am trying to evaluate the effeciency of
my own development process.  Effeciency has always be an imporant part of my life because as a guy with Cerebral Palsy finding the best path to gethrough life as been tricky to say the least.</p>
<p>I love my life and I wouldn't change a thing about. It took me a long time to be as happy as I am with my life. As they say, "carpe diem" or "Seize the Day", I dont let my Disability get in the way of me achieving the things I want in life.  The doctors, the research online, and the public qualify my Cerebral Palsy as a physical disbilty because my mental capacity has not been effected. The issues that get caused from my disbility stem not from my body or muscles but my brain that sends the singles.</p>
<p>The thing that I continue to learn from this is that a disablity gets defined not but what is but rather the symtoms that it creates.  I say this because, we as people give meaning to things as they are defined and not as they actually are.</p>
<p>This is prevelent in the medical community as a doctor comes to see a patient a diagnose a problem.  When the issue is something life threating this is amazing. I don't want to say here that what doctors do is not great and or amazing because it is. What I would like to say is that when a doctor comes in and diagnoses a problem like Cerebral Palsy they are throwing out the rule book on life. We have to define everything for ourselves and should reguardless of Cerebral Palsy or not. I have defines my Cerebral Palys.</p>

	<blockquote>"I have a mental perspective of what I can do that needs to be thrown out daily."</blockquote>

<p>Wether I am trying to develop a website and I think it can't be done or I am attempting to hike the Appalachian Trail, and just as Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon I am the first man to have ever done anything with my condition. A bit of a dramatic example I know, but true in essentials. There has been thousands of people who have had Cerebral Palsy but none of them have had my exact symptoms.</p>
